Declaration VS Definition VS Initialization VS Assignment

Order:
Declaration
Definition		Initialization is all three steps at once
Assignment


Declaration:
	int func();
	
Declaration then definition:
	int func();
	
	int func()
	{
		return 1;
	}

Declaration and Definition:
	int x;
	
Declaration, Definition, and then Assignment:
	int x;
	x = 0;
	
Initialization:
	int x = 0;
	
	

	
	
Declaration(variable):
	extern int x; //extern doesn't actually set aside memory for x, it just says that there is an object called x, but it's located somewhere else, like in a header file or a library
